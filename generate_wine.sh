# This script generates wine wrapper for each exe in the SGDK bin directory.
# It also generates makefile_wine.gen (same as makefile.gen with variables 
# RM, CP and MKDIR set to native unix utilities and SHELL removed).
# It should be run once from within the SGDK bin directory.
# The following command should then be able to build any SGDK project:
# make GDK=/path/to/sgdk -f /path/to/sgdk/makefile_wine.gen

# Tested with SGDK 1.60, see github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/releases

# Known issues: The file makelib.gen does not work with this method.
