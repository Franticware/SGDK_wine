# This script generates wine wrapper for each exe in the SGDK bin directory.
# It also generates makefile_wine.gen (same as makefile.gen minus line containing "SHELL=").
# It should be run once from within the SGDK bin directory.
# The following command should then be able to build any SGDK project:
# make GDK=/path/to/sgdk -f /path/to/sgdk/makefile_wine.gen

# Tested with SGDK 1.51, see github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK
# Known issues: File names/paths with spaces cause issues.
